## Description
Site to create "minus" --- arrangements without voice, from the original audio file

With the help of the LibROSA library, it is supposed to select a vocal part from an audio track with its subsequent deletion.
In addition, the main page of the site displays an interactive map, where each region is associated with the artist whose songs were requested by users from this region most often.
Besides, an audio Fund of covers and a rating system of users may be created.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
